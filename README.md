Question:
We didn't define any UX flow to let users edit a description on an existing TODO item.
Which UX flow will you define?
I will define the option to edit the text as follows:
I will create an option to click on the entire item, and then the app will take the user to a new activity,
Where the text of the task and an edit button will appear. At the end of the edit, the activity will return
us to the main activity when the text is updated accordingly.
The development of this feature will require an additional activity with a new button inside.
In addition, we will send the updated text with a broadcast to the main activity.
The development I have described is consistent with respect to the Android world, as the Google Tasks app
features similar functionality.

I pledge the highest level of ethical principles in support of academic excellence.
I ensure that all of my work reflects my own abilities and not those of someone else.
